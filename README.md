# **"Modern Fullstack Framework"**

This summary provides a holistic view of our project, encapsulating our vision, goals, and implementation plan.

---

**Vision:**

To create a powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly framework for building modern web applications, leveraging the strengths of Django (for backend), Svelte (for frontend), Rust (for CLI), and GitHub (for collaboration and automation). This framework will prioritize a great developer experience (DX), emphasize reusability, and enable rapid development.

---

**Core Components:**

1. **Rust CLI Tool:**
   * **Purpose:** To bootstrap new Django/Svelte projects with our tools, with customizable options.
   * **Technology:** Rust, `clap` , templating engine.
   * **Distribution:** Single executable via GitHub releases.

2. **Django Backend (Core App):**
   * **Purpose:** To provide API endpoints, manage data, and handle business logic.
   * **Technology:** Django, DRF, Python.
   * **Features:** Custom authentication, API endpoints for models and configurations, plugin system.
   * **Distribution:** Reusable PyPI package.

3. **Svelte Frontend (Admin Panel & Reusable Components):**
   * **Purpose:** To provide a dynamic, customizable, and reactive user interface.
   * **Technology:** Svelte, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, pnpm.
   * **Features:**
     * Library of reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, forms, lists, tables, modals, etc.) with flexible options and styles.
     * Dynamic UI rendering based on database configurations.
     * Admin interface built using the reusable components.
     * Data fetching utilities.
     * Plugin system.
   * **Distribution:** Reusable npm package.

4. **Template Repository:**
   * **Purpose:** To provide a "starter" project for those who want to start with a complete setup, using the reusable components.
   * **Distribution:** GitHub repository.

5. **Configuration Management:**
   * **Purpose:** To allow dynamic configuration of UI components.
   * **Technology:** Database models, DRF API.
   * **Features:** Manage UI configurations, layout, permissions, components, from the admin panel.

6. **Plugin System:**
   * **Purpose:** To provide extensibility for Django and Svelte.
   * **Technology:** Django signals/events, custom APIs, Svelte custom components.

7. **Version Control and CI/CD:**
   * **Technology:** Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions.
   * **Features:** Automate testing, building, releases, documentation updates.

8. **Documentation:**
   * **Technology:** GitHub Pages, documentation generator.
   * **Features:** Centralized documentation, code documentation, examples.

---

**Key Principles:**

* **Developer Experience (DX):** Focus on making the framework enjoyable and easy to use for developers.
* **Reusability:** Create reusable components, services, and utilities that can be used across different projects.
* **Extensibility:** Design the system to be easily extended using APIs, plugins, and configurations.
* **Customizability:** Provide ways to customize the UI and backend using dynamic configurations.
* **Modularity:** Break the project into small, independent modules and components.
* **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to SOLID principles in all components.
* **Testability:** Ensure that every component can be tested.
* **Performance:** Prioritize performance throughout the system.
* **Collaboration:** Encourage open-source contributions by using GitHub and a well-defined workflow.

---

**Distribution Channels:**

* **GitHub:** For source code, issue tracking, project management, and collaboration.
* **GitHub Releases:** For distributing the Rust CLI tool.
* **npm:** For distributing the Svelte component library.
* **PyPI:** For distributing the Django app.
* **GitHub Pages:** For hosting documentation.

---

**Target Audience:**

* Web developers who want to build modern, full-stack web applications.
* Developers who prioritize a great DX, modern workflows, extensibility, and performance.
* Beginners who want to start with a template that gives a working project.
* Developers who want to reuse components in their existing projects, using a robust npm and PyPI library.

---

**Overall Strategy:**

* **Iterative Development:** Develop the framework in small, iterative cycles, with each iteration delivering a tangible value.
* **Feature-Driven Approach:** Each iteration should deliver working and tested functionality.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automate testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
* **Documentation as Code:** Treat documentation as code that is automatically updated and deployed.

---

**Technology Choices:**

* **Rust** for CLI
* **Django** for backend, Django REST framework for API, and Django ORM
* **Svelte** for frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling.
* **pnpm** for package management.
* **uv** for Python package management
* **SQLite** for development, PostgreSQL/MySQL for production.
* **Git, GitHub and GitHub Actions** for collaboration, and automation.
* **Jinja2, Handlebars** for templating.

---

**Success Criteria:**

* A fully working CLI tool that can create new projects easily.
* A powerful and easy-to-use Django app.
* A flexible and highly reusable Svelte library.
* Dynamic UI rendering using configurations.
* An active open-source community.
* A complete documentation set for all users.
* A fully automated CI/CD pipeline.
* A great DX.
